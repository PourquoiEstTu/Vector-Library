# Simple Vector and Matrix Library
These are modules for working with vectors and matrices of any size in python which is currently being developed. 
Mostly simple and common vector operations like dot products, addition, and scalar multiplication are defined.
Common matrix operations like matrix multiplication and transposes are in development
For the specifics, look at the help functions of the classes for a brief overview on what they do and how to instantiate the objects.
NOTE: Even if you only need to do matrix operations, the Matrix class inherits from the Vector class, so you need both files to use the Matrix class.
If you only need the vector class, then you can only download the vectorClass.py file and it will work fine.
